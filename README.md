# metro-nav

Metronav is a C++ program-based project designed to assist users in calculating fares and finding the shortest metro route between a source and destination station in the Delhi Metro.

**Functionality:**
The program allows users to input their source and destination stations, and it then calculates the fare for the journey. Additionally, it employs various path-finding algorithms to determine the shortest route between the given stations.

**Path-finding Algorithms:**
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Greedy Best-First Search
Algorithm Applications:

**Conclusion:**
Metronav was a rewarding project that allowed me to apply path-finding algorithms in a real-world scenario. It showcases my proficiency in C++ programming and algorithm design while providing a useful tool for Delhi Metro commuters to plan their journeys efficiently.
